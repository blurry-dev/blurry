# Blurry: A static site generator for SEO and page speed

## What is Blurry?

Blurry is a static site generator, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), with a big pun of a name: if you're generating static sight, you're making things Blurry.

If you're looking for a static site generator in Python that's as [easy to customize](./plugins/intro.md) as it is to use, give Blurry a try!

## Goals

### üìà SEO performance

Blurry supports [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) and [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) with zero configuration.
This enables [rich Google results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) and [link previews](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) out-of-the-box.

### üèéÔ∏è Page speed

While using Blurry doesn't guarantee good page speed, it does solve a number of pain points that tend to slow down page loads.

[Blurry's image handling](../content/images.md) and HTML minification, for instance, can help get you a 100/100 [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) score if the rest of your site is fast.

### ‚öô Minimal configuration

Blurry has sensible defaults so you can spend less time configuring and more time writing.

A viable [Blurry configuration file](./configuration/blurry.toml.md) can be as simple as:

```toml
[blurry]
domain = "johnfraney.ca"
```

### üß© Exensibility

Blurry supports [plugins](./plugins/intro.md) to make it easy to add functionality for:

- [Markdown customization](./plugins/write-a-markdown-plugin.md)
- Jinja [filters](./plugins/write-a-jinja-filter-plugin.md) & [extensions](./plugins/write-a-jinja-extension-plugin.md)
- [HTML post-processing](./plugins/write-an-html-plugin.md)

## Non-goals

### üöÑ "Gotta go fast!"

While Blurry aims to be performant, build performance is not its top priority.
It's written in Python, so it _may_ not be able to compete on speed with other static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Instead, it aims to be _fast_enough_ while optimizing for developer and user experience.
